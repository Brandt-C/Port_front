                <p>An idea was born of making stories out of characters from a fictional universe in the style of Madlibs.  Only one you say???
                    Now we're on the same page!  With choices from several different universes you can create wonky, wacky, and fun stories blending characters and locations into. . .uh, stories of the Madiverse.

                <p>That kid who took apart the remote, game-controller, cd-player (showing age now huh?), bike, car and more: that was me!  At least half of those things got put back together and a couple were even improved!  Now I've taken that same success ratio and applied it to software and apps.  Watch out internet, some small portions of you are due for improvement. . . </p>
